      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Lubao is recognized as one of the oldest towns in Pampanga and is often called the Cradle of Kapampangan Civilization. Early riverbank settlers formed communities along waterways and estuaries, building trade networks and cultural roots. During the Spanish colonial era, Lubao gained institutional importance, with religious missions, local governance, and agricultural development anchoring its place in the region. Over the centuries, Lubao’s identity grew in tandem with both nature and settlement.

        In modern times, Lubao adapted through resilient recovery after disasters and through growth in agriculture, trade, and civic life. It thrives today as a first-class municipality, honored for being the birthplace of leaders and preserving heritage structures. Its people continue to sustain traditional customs and combine them with modern ambitions, positioning Lubao as both guardian of history and driver of progress.
