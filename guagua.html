      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Guagua is one of Pampanga’s oldest towns, located along the banks of the Pampanga River where early settlers found fertile lands and abundant water sources. During Spanish colonization, it prospered as a trading post connecting inland towns to river routes and coastal areas. Its name is believed to stem from local terms referencing water or streams. Over time, Guagua evolved as a hub for agriculture, small trade, and local governance, reflecting the broader growth of the Pampanga region.

      <p>
        In the 20th century, Guagua deepened its place in regional life through increased infrastructure, public education, and local industry. Even in times of crisis such as floods or typhoons, the town has adapted by improving water control systems and community resilience. Today, Guagua stands as a vibrant municipality that honors its historical roots while participating in modern commerce, civic life, and cultural expression.
