      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Floridablanca was established during the Spanish colonial era as a waystation between central Pampanga and coastal towns. It originally developed as a barrio under nearby municipalities until it was formally organized into a town. Through the 1800s and into the American era, Floridablanca evolved through agriculture, local trade, and growing faith-based community life. The town has always maintained its agrarian character even as it gradually modernized with better roads, local markets, and civic infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the 20th century, Floridablanca gained identity through its fertile lands, which supported rice, sugarcane, and vegetable farming. Its location near rivers and secondary roads allowed it to engage in trade with neighboring municipalities. The town also sustained community resilience by preserving culture and local governance traditions while embracing new development initiatives in education, health, and commerce.
