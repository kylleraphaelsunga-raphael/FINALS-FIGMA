      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Minalin, Pampanga, was originally founded in 1614 as a small visita (sub-parish) of Macabebe. By 1624, it became an independent parish, reflecting the growing population and significance of the settlement. The town was officially established as a municipality in 1699. Its name is believed to have come from the Kapampangan phrase "minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban," meaning "the lumber moved, and so must the church," referring to a flood that carried construction materials intended for the Santa Monica Parish Church, leading to the relocation of the church and the town adopting its current name.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Spanish colonial period, Minalin flourished as an agricultural town, with rice farming and fishing serving as primary sources of livelihood. The Santa Monica Parish Church, constructed in 1721, became a central symbol of the town’s faith and cultural identity. Its intricate architectural design, blending pre-colonial Kapampangan motifs with European Catholic iconography, houses murals and religious artifacts that reflect both local traditions and Spanish influence. The town also became known for its vibrant festivals and community gatherings, fostering a strong sense of identity among residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the American period and throughout the 20th century, Minalin continued to develop as a hub for culture and tradition while modernizing infrastructure and public services. Today, Minalin maintains its rich heritage through the preservation of its historic landmarks, such as the Santa Monica Parish Church, and its continued celebration of unique local traditions like the "Aguman Sanduk" New Year’s festival, where men dress as beauty queens and parade through town. The municipality has grown economically and socially, balancing its historical roots with contemporary progress, making it a living example of Kapampangan resilience, faith, and cultural pride.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name "Minalin" is derived from the Kapampangan phrase "minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban," which translates to "the lumber moved, and so must the church." This refers to the incident where floodwaters carried away construction materials intended for the Santa Monica Parish Church, leading to its relocation and the town adopting its current name.
