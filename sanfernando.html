    <h1>CITY OF SAN FERNANDO</h1>
    <h3>Provincial Capital of Pampanga</h3>
    <h3>Christmas Capital of the Philippines</h3>

    <section>
      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>San Fernando, the capital of Pampanga, was established as a town in 1754 when it was carved out from the municipalities of Bacolor and Mexico. It was named after King Ferdinand VI of Spain, and since then, it has played a central role in the province’s history and governance. During the Spanish period, San Fernando flourished as a trading and agricultural hub, while also becoming a center of faith with the establishment of its parish church. The town was later involved in revolutionary movements, with many Kapampangans from San Fernando joining uprisings against Spanish and American colonizers. In the American era, the arrival of the railway connecting Manila to Dagupan passed through San Fernando, further boosting its economy and accessibility. In the aftermath of World War II, San Fernando rose from destruction and continued to strengthen its role as Pampanga’s seat of government. It achieved cityhood on February 4, 2001 through Republic Act No. 8990, and today it is known as the “Christmas Capital of the Philippines” for its world-renowned Giant Lantern Festival.</p>

      <p>San Fernando City has a land area of about 67.74 square kilometers and is politically subdivided into 35 barangays, including Dolores, Sto. Rosario, Sindalan, Telabastagan, Del Pilar, San Jose, Calulut, Sta. Lucia, Malpitic, San Isidro, and Maimpis, among others. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of over 354,000 residents, making it one of the largest and most urbanized cities in Central Luzon. San Fernando is home to major commercial centers such as SM City Pampanga and Robinsons Starmills, which make the city a retail and business hub. Its cultural and religious landmarks include the Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, the Bren Z. Guiao Convention Center, and the Death March marker, which commemorates the city’s role during World War II. The city also celebrates the Fiesta of Our Lady of the Assumption and the world-famous Ligligan Parul (Giant Lantern Festival) held every December, drawing visitors from around the world. Today, San Fernando continues to grow as Pampanga’s political, cultural, and economic center, blending historical pride with modern urban development.</p>

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>The name San Fernando was given in honor of King Ferdinand VI of Spain, who ruled during the time of the town’s creation. The Spanish friars and leaders dedicated the town to the monarch, which was a common practice during colonial times. Over the years, the name came to symbolize not only its colonial heritage but also the resilience and pride of its people.</p>
