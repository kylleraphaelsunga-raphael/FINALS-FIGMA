      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Santo Tomas, officially known as the Municipality of Santo Tomas, has a rich history that dates back to the late 18th century. Originally, the area was a small settlement under the jurisdiction of Minalin and was known as "Baliwag," a name thought to reference the locals’ tendency to arrive late for Mass. Over time, the community grew steadily, as early settlers relied primarily on agriculture and fishing for their livelihood. Rice fields, sugarcane plantations, and small orchards formed the backbone of the local economy, while local trade with neighboring towns helped the settlement thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the early 1800s, Baliwag had become a bustling barrio with a small chapel serving the spiritual needs of its inhabitants. The growing population necessitated the establishment of a formal parish, and the town gradually shifted its religious and administrative center. In 1855, the Spanish colonial government officially renamed the settlement to "Pueblo de Santo Tomas" in honor of Saint Thomas the Apostle, reflecting both the community’s strong Catholic faith and the Spanish practice of linking towns to patron saints. This change marked a turning point for the town, fostering a deeper sense of identity and unity among its residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the late 19th century, Santo Tomas played a role in the Philippine Revolution and the subsequent Philippine–American War. The Battle of Santo Tomas in 1899 was a notable event, where local residents and revolutionary forces resisted American troops, demonstrating the town’s commitment to independence and self-determination. Despite the hardships of war, the community continued to rebuild and prosper, retaining its cultural traditions while adapting to new political realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 20th century brought further development, especially after World War II. Santo Tomas was officially chartered as a municipality on October 12, 1951, through Executive Order No. 476, signed by President Elpidio Quirino. This legal recognition allowed for more structured governance and the establishment of essential services, such as schools, public markets, and healthcare facilities. The town’s economy gradually diversified, with small-scale industries complementing its agricultural base. Notably, Santo Tomas became a hub for casket manufacturing, a unique industry that would later earn the town the nickname "Casket Capital of Central Luzon."
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Santo Tomas balances its historical and cultural heritage with modern economic growth. The town is composed of numerous barangays, each preserving traditions while contributing to the overall development of the municipality. Its annual feast day, celebrated in honor of Saint Thomas the Apostle, remains a central cultural event, drawing residents and visitors together in a display of faith, food, and local artistry. Santo Tomas stands as a testament to resilience, industry, and community spirit, blending its past with present achievements to ensure a prosperous future.
