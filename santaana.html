      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Ana, Pampanga, is a first-class municipality with a rich history rooted in faith, agriculture, and resilience. Originally part of Arayat, the area was known as “Bale Pinpin,” meaning “laid aside,” reflecting its early status as a sparsely populated settlement. In 1598, it became a visita (a small mission town) of Arayat, where early settlers cultivated the fertile lands and established the foundations of a thriving agricultural community. Over time, the settlement grew in population and significance, leading to the construction of a parish church dedicated to Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary, in 1753.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the late 18th century, Santa Ana had become an important agricultural hub, supplying rice, sugarcane, and other crops to neighboring towns. During the Spanish colonial period, the town endured natural calamities and uprisings but maintained its local governance and religious practices. When the Philippines transitioned to American rule, Santa Ana benefited from infrastructure improvements, including roads and public schools, which further integrated the town into the province of Pampanga.
      </p>
      <p>
        Santa Ana officially became a municipality on January 1, 1913, marking its independence and enabling it to develop a stronger local government. The town’s growth continued throughout the 20th century, even as it faced challenges such as typhoons and flooding from nearby rivers. Despite these obstacles, the community preserved its traditions and maintained strong devotion to Saint Anne, celebrating her feast day with annual religious processions, music, and cultural activities. Today, Santa Ana balances its agricultural roots with modern development, including small businesses, schools, and infrastructure projects, while preserving its historical landmarks like the centuries-old Santa Ana Church and ancestral houses that stand as witnesses to its enduring legacy.

The name symbolizes the town's devotion, hope, and resilience, values that the residents have upheld through generations. Originally known as "Bale Pinpin," the settlement adopted the new name to honor the saint and establish a distinct identity for the growing community.
