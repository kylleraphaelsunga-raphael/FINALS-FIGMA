    <h1>MUNICIPALITY OF PORAC</h1>
    <h3>Largest Town in Pampanga</h3>

    <section>
      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Porac is one of the oldest towns in Pampanga, with a history dating back to pre-colonial times. 
        Its name is derived from the word “Purac,” a type of forest tree that once thrived abundantly in the area. 
        The town played a significant role during the Spanish period as an agricultural settlement and became a thriving 
        community due to its fertile lands. Historical records show that the town was already organized by the late 1500s, 
        making it one of Pampanga’s early settlements. Throughout history, Porac has been both a farming hub and a site of 
        resistance, with locals joining revolutionary movements during the Spanish and American periods. The 1991 eruption 
        of Mount Pinatubo also heavily affected Porac, burying vast lands under lahar and displacing communities. Despite 
        these challenges, the town has steadily rebuilt itself and is now one of Pampanga’s fastest-developing municipalities, 
        with modern industries, eco-parks, and real estate developments rising across its landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Porac is the largest municipality in Pampanga in terms of land area, covering about 314 square kilometers, 
        and is divided into 29 barangays, including Babo Pangulo, Jalung, Manibaug Paralaya, Planas, Pias, Poblacion, 
        Pulung Santol, Sta. Cruz, Sapang Uwak, and Villa Maria, among others. According to the 2020 census, Porac has a 
        population of more than 140,000 residents. The town is known for its agricultural products, particularly sugarcane 
        and rice, and has recently welcomed industries in food processing, quarrying, and housing developments. Eco-tourism 
        has also grown, with attractions such as Miyamit Falls, Darabulbul Falls, and the Poracay Eco Park drawing visitors. 
        The town celebrates the Feast of St. Catherine of Alexandria, its patron saint, every November, highlighting its strong 
        religious traditions. With its vast lands, scenic mountain ranges, and expanding industries, Porac continues to balance 
        its agricultural roots with modern economic growth, making it a rising hub in Pampanga’s development.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name “Porac” comes from the word purac, a type of plant that once grew abundantly in the area. 
        When Spanish explorers asked locals about the place, they were told about the presence of these plants, 
        leading to the adoption of the name Porac. This reflects how the town’s natural environment shaped its identity.

      <h2>TRADEMARK OF PORAC</h2>
      <p>
        Porac is best known for its quarry industry, especially after the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, when lahar deposits 
        made quarrying a major source of livelihood. It is also recognized for its eco-tourism spots, such as Miyamit Falls, 
        Dara Falls, and the viewing point at Poracay Resort. Recently, Porac has gained attention for large real estate projects 
        like Alviera, which promote it as a developing modern community while still showcasing its natural beauty. Religious 
        traditions also remain strong, with devotion to Santa Catalina de Alejandria, the town’s patron saint.
