      <h2>STORY FOR CREATION</h2>
      <p>This website was created as part of our midterm and final project, where we combined design and development to bring ideas to life. Using Figma for the design stage and HTML & CSS for building the website, we wanted to show how creativity in design can be translated into a working web page.</p>

      <h2>MISSION OF THIS WEBSITE</h2>
      <p>The mission is to connect design and development by turning ideas into real projects. Through this website, we aim to practice using Figma for design and HTML/CSS for coding, while making the experience fun and engaging by featuring Pampanga’s rich heritage.</p>

      <h2>VISION OF THIS WEBSITE</h2>
      <p>The vision is to create a project that not only fulfills our midterm and final requirements but also shows how design and coding can work together. We hope this website helps others see that learning web development can be both educational and enjoyable while appreciating the culture of Pampanga.</p>
