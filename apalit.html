      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Apalit is one of the oldest towns in Pampanga, established during the Spanish colonial era. Its origins trace back to the late 1500s when it started as a small settlement near the Pampanga River, which played a vital role in the town’s early trade and livelihood. The name "Apalit" is believed to have come from a local tree called “Apalit” that once thrived in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Spanish period, Apalit became known for its strong Christian faith and devotion, leading to the construction of churches and religious structures that became central to community life. The town flourished as a trading hub due to its strategic river location, connecting it to nearby provinces via waterways. Over the years, Apalit developed its identity through traditions such as the Libad Festival, which celebrates its deep devotion to Saint Peter. Today, Apalit stands as a thriving municipality known for its culture, faith, and commerce.
