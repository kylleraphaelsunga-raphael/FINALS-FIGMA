    <h1>CITY OF MABALACAT</h1>
    <h3>Gateway to Central Luzon</h3>

    <section>
      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Mabalacat City was originally a barrio of Bamban, Tarlac before becoming an independent town in 1792.
        Its earliest settlers were the Aetas, led by their chieftain Caragan, who thrived in the forests where
        Balacat trees were abundant, inspiring the city’s name. Over time, Kapampangans and migrants from nearby
        provinces settled in the area, fostering growth and development. By the late 1800s, the town had already
        established its own church, schools, and barangays, marking its rise as an important Pampanga community.
        During the American period, a large portion of Mabalacat’s land was turned into Fort Stotsenburg, later
        known as Clark Air Base, which influenced its economy and culture for decades. The 1991 eruption of Mount
        Pinatubo prompted the U.S. military’s departure, after which the land was transformed into the Clark
        Freeport Zone, unlocking new opportunities in trade, tourism, and aviation. On July 21, 2012, Mabalacat
        was officially converted into a component city of Pampanga through Republic Act No. 10164, making it the
        province’s third city after Angeles and San Fernando. Today, it thrives as a growing economic hub and is
        widely recognized as the “Gateway to Central Luzon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Mabalacat City has a total land area of about 83.18 square kilometers and is politically subdivided into
        27 barangays, including Dau, Mabiga, San Joaquin, Dolores, Sapang Biabas, Camachiles, Tabun, Mamatitang,
        Poblacion, San Francisco, Atlu Bola, Calumpang, Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Lakandula, Marcos Village,
        Mangalit, San Isidro, San Francisco, and Sapang Balas, among others. According to the 2020 census, the
        city has a population of more than 293,000 residents, making it one of Pampanga’s most populous areas.
        It plays a vital role in regional commerce because of its strategic location beside Angeles City and Clark
        Freeport Zone, and it is directly connected to major road networks like the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX)
        and Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). Educational institutions such as Mabalacat City College and
        various public and private schools serve its residents, while health facilities and public services
        continue to expand. The city celebrates local fiestas such as the Fiesta of Our Lady of Grace Parish in
        Dau and the Feast of San Rafael in Poblacion, showcasing its strong Kapampangan faith and traditions.
        Mabalacat is also home to key landmarks like the Clark International Airport, portions of the Clark
        Freeport Zone, and heritage sites such as the San Rafael Archangel Parish Church, all of which highlight
        its balance of historical significance and modern progress.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name Mabalacat comes from the phrase “Ma-balacat,” which means “full of Balacat trees.”
        The Balacat tree is strong and resilient, with bark used for medicinal purposes. Because of
        its abundance in the area, the town took its name from this tree, and it remains a symbol
        of the city’s identity.

      <h2>TRADEMARK OF MABALACAT</h2>
      <p>
        Mabalacat is best known as the “Gateway to Central Luzon” since it covers most of the Clark
        Freeport Zone and the Clark International Airport. It is also famous for the Caragan Festival,
        a colorful celebration every February that honors the Aeta heritage and culture. Another important
        tradition in Mabalacat is the Pastorella, where Latin hymns are sung during Christmas Masses,
        preserving a centuries-old practice.
