      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Macabebe is one of the oldest towns in Pampanga, believed to have been established as early as the pre-colonial period due to its strategic location along the Pampanga River. The town played a significant role in Philippine history, particularly during the Spanish era when Macabebe warriors were noted for their skill and loyalty in battle. In 1571, Macabebe fighters, led by Tarik Soliman, bravely resisted the forces of Miguel López de Legazpi in the Battle of Bangkusay, marking one of the earliest recorded uprisings against Spanish rule. Although their resistance was defeated, their legacy lives on as symbols of Kapampangan courage and pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the American period, Macabebe scouts became known as the first Filipino soldiers to serve under the newly established Philippine Constabulary, contributing greatly to military history. Despite facing change across different eras, Macabebe remained a strong fishing and trading community due to its connection to major waterways. Today, the town stands as a reminder of the bravery of its ancestors and the resilience of Kapampangans throughout time, proudly preserving both its heritage and cultural identity.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name “Macabebe” is derived from the word “bebe,” which means “riverbank” in the Kapampangan language. The prefix “maca” implies being “along” or “by,” giving the meaning “those who live by the river.” True to its name, the town’s identity and livelihood have always been tied to the Pampanga River, which shaped its culture, trade, and way of life throughout history.
