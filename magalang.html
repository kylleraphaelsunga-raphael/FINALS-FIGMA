      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Magalang is a historic town nestled at the base of Mount Arayat, one of the most iconic natural landmarks in Pampanga. The town traces its roots to the early Spanish colonial period, when missionaries and Augustinian friars began establishing settlements across Central Luzon. Originally located in a place called San Bartolome, the town was forced to relocate after a series of calamities, including floods and epidemics, which devastated the original settlement. The people, resilient and united, transferred to the current site and rebuilt their community with renewed hope and strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Spanish era, Magalang became a thriving agricultural town due to its fertile land nourished by the mountain’s natural springs. It later gained prominence with the establishment of an agricultural school—now known as Pampanga State Agricultural University, one of the oldest agricultural institutions in the country. The town played a vital role in training farmers and promoting agricultural innovation, earning it recognition beyond Pampanga.
