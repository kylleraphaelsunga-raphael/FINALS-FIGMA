      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Rita, officially known as the Municipality of Santa Rita, traces its origins to 1697 when it began as a settlement called Gasac, now Barangay San Isidro. During this period, the town was under the jurisdiction of Porac, which managed its political and religious affairs. In 1724, Santa Rita was officially separated from Porac, though it was not yet recognized as a separate parish. The town's religious independence was achieved in 1771, marking a significant milestone in its development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The construction of the Santa Rita de Cascia Parish Church commenced in the 1830s and was completed in the 1860s. This church stands as a testament to the town's rich history and cultural heritage. Over the years, Santa Rita has evolved from a modest settlement into a thriving municipality known for its agricultural prowess and vibrant community life.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name "Santa Rita" is derived from St. Rita of Cascia, an Italian saint known for her piety and devotion. The town adopted her name in the late 18th century, reflecting the community's deep religious roots and the saint's influence on their spiritual life.
