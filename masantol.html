      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Masantol was originally part of Macabebe until local leaders petitioned for independence. On June 26, 1877, Manuel Fajardo, Gregorio Bautista, and Juan Lacap filed an appeal to separate the barrios of Bebe, Bulacus, Caingin, and Nigui. Their request was approved, and on May 1, 1878, the new pueblo of San Miguel de Masantol was officially recognized during the Spanish colonial period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The town’s religious and cultural identity strengthened with the establishment of its own parish on January 13, 1894, formally separating it ecclesiastically from Macabebe. The church was completed in 1901 and later renovated by devoted parishioners and clergy, standing today as a symbol of the town’s faith and unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1904, due to administrative restructuring under American rule, Masantol was merged back with Macabebe. However, the spirit of its people remained strong, and in 1907, Masantol officially regained its status as an independent municipality. Despite experiencing constant flooding and environmental challenges due to its location near Manila Bay and river channels, Masantol has remained a town defined by resilience, community spirit, and deep cultural roots.

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name “Masantol” is believed to have originated from the abundance of <em>santol</em> trees in the area. According to local tales, early traders transporting baskets of santol fruits often referred to the area as “Maraming Santol,” which eventually shortened to “Masantol.” Another folk story claims that a Spanish friar, upon asking locals about the place, was told “Mas santol po,” and mistook it as the name of the town.
