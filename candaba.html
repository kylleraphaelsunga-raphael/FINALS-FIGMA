      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Candaba lies on one of the most remarkable landscapes in Pampanga: vast flood plains and the celebrated Candaba Swamp, which once formed part of a chain of inland lakes in Central Luzon. Early settlers made their community along the Pampanga River, taking advantage of rich soils and waterways. Under Spanish rule, the town matured with agricultural and fishery foundations, contributing to local trade. Over the decades, Candaba has sustained both floodwaters and farmland, adapting its environment into a functioning tapestry of nature and livelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the 20th century and into modern times, Candaba has become known for its dual identity: as a sanctuary for migratory birds and as a productive agricultural municipality. The seasonally flooded swamps, once obstacles, turned into fertile fields and wetlands that support rice, tilapia, duck-egg farms, and honeyed watermelons. Sitting at the lowest point in the Central Luzon plain, Candaba embraces its natural rhythms and continues to thrive despite climate challenges and changing land uses.

    <!-- ===== STORY BEHIND THE NAME ===== -->
    <section>
      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>
        The name “Candaba” traces back to indigenous references of waterways and swamp land in this region. Originally known as Candawe, the settlement gradually became Candaba as the Kapampangan language and Spanish-era records merged. The name reflects the interplay of land and water that defines the municipality’s character: half swamp, half farm, always adapting.
