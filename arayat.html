      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Arayat is one of the most historic municipalities in Pampanga, believed to have been founded during the early Spanish colonial period. Its strategic location at the foot of Mount Arayat made it a thriving settlement for early Kapampangans who depended on agriculture, river trade, and mountain resources. The town played an important role in local commerce due to its proximity to the Pampanga River, connecting it to nearby communities through water-based trade routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Spanish rule, Arayat became known for its strong devotion to Catholicism, leading to the establishment of religious structures and traditions that shaped its cultural identity. The fertile lands surrounding the area allowed it to flourish agriculturally, producing rice, sugarcane, and native crops that contributed to its economic stability. Today, Arayat stands as a symbol of cultural heritage and natural beauty, with Mount Arayat serving as its most iconic landmark and a constant reminder of the town’s historical roots.
