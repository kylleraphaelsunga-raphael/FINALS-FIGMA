      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Angeles City traces its beginnings to the late 1700s when Don Ángel Pantaleón de Miranda and his wife Doña Rosalía de Jesús moved from San Fernando to establish a settlement called “Culiat,” named after a vine abundant in the area. The town grew rapidly, and in 1829 it was officially separated from San Fernando, becoming a recognized municipality. Over the years, it developed into an important center for trade and agriculture in Pampanga. During the American period, the establishment of Clark Air Base just north of the town transformed Angeles into a cosmopolitan hub, attracting businesses, education, and cultural influences from abroad. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo’s eruption devastated much of the city and forced the withdrawal of the U.S. Air Force from Clark, but Angeles quickly recovered and reinvented itself as a commercial and tourism center. By 1964, it had already achieved cityhood through Republic Act No. 3700, making it one of Pampanga’s most progressive urban areas. Today, Angeles City is widely recognized as the “Entertainment Capital of Central Luzon” and a vital gateway to Clark Freeport and Clark International Airport.

        Angeles City covers a land area of about 60 square kilometers and is politically divided into 33 barangays, including Balibago, Anunas, Sapangbato, Pulung Maragul, Malabanias, Pandan, Sta. Teresita, Sto. Rosario, Lourdes Sur, Cutcut, and Salapungan, among others. It has a population of over 462,000 residents (2020 census), making it the most populous city in Pampanga. The city is home to several prominent educational institutions, including Holy Angel University, Angeles University Foundation, and systems of international schools. Landmarks such as the Holy Rosary Parish Church (Pisamban Maragul), Pamintuan Mansion, and Museo Ning Angeles preserve its heritage, while modern attractions like Walking Street, commercial malls, and business parks fuel its economy. Angeles celebrates grand festivities such as the Sisig Festival, honoring its world-famous dish, and Holy Week traditions centered at the Holy Rosary Parish. Today, the city balances its rich Kapampangan culture with modern progress, serving as one of the region’s cultural, educational, and economic</p>

      <h2>STORY BEHIND THE NAME</h2>
      <p>The name “Angeles” comes from its founder, Don Ángel Pantaleón de Miranda, and literally means “City of Angels.” Originally called Culiat, after the vine plants that grew abundantly in the area, the town adopted the new name to reflect its founder’s legacy and identity. This name symbolizes both reverence to its beginnings and pride in its cultural roots.</p>

      <p>Angeles City is widely recognized as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines. It is the birthplace of sisig, a sizzling pork dish now famous worldwide.

Angeles is also notable for its heritage sites like the Holy Rosary Parish Church, dubbed the “big church” by locals, which stands as a testament to the city’s Spanish-era past, and the Pamintuan Mansion, which once served as the residence of the first Philippine President, Emilio Aguinaldo, during the Philippine Revolution.</p>
