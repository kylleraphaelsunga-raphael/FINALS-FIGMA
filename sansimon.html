    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
        San Simon, Pampanga, was originally part of Bacolor and officially became an independent municipality in 1771. Early settlers were primarily farmers and fishermen, drawn to the fertile lands along the Pampanga River. Agriculture became the backbone of the community, with rice, sugarcane, and vegetables sustaining livelihoods and trade with nearby towns. During the Spanish colonial period, the town developed several Catholic parishes, highlighting the strong influence of faith in daily life. The people of San Simon were active participants in local uprisings and community initiatives, which fostered a culture of resilience and unity.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the 20th century, San Simon gradually modernized with the establishment of schools, marketplaces, and infrastructure that connected it to other parts of Pampanga and Central Luzon. The town preserved its religious traditions, celebrating annual fiestas honoring its patron saint, Saint Simon, while integrating new agricultural techniques and small-scale industries. Today, San Simon maintains its historical and cultural roots while embracing development. Modern irrigation systems, community centers, and educational institutions reflect the town’s progress, yet its festivals, local crafts, and agricultural heritage continue to define its unique identity in Pampanga.
    </p>
    <p>
        From its beginnings as a riverside settlement to its present role as a thriving municipality, San Simon exemplifies the balance of tradition and progress. Its residents continue to honor the town’s history while contributing to sustainable agriculture, local commerce, and community cohesion, making San Simon a remarkable example of heritage and modern growth coexisting harmoniously.
